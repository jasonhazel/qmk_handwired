30% choc spaced ortholinear

# purpose

the plan is to use a xiao for the small footprint, which means using zmk at the end of the day. i'm better with qmk, so i'll use it to get the hardware ironed out.  i personally don't want to use a 30% so this is more a simple project to get better with pcb design and zmk.
